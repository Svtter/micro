# Micro

> current_status: prototype.

... Python microservice framework.

More in [Document](./docs/docs/index.md). You should clone this project and run `inv docs`.

## Install

<!-- ```bash
# let's see who can laugh at the end. Java.
pip install micromicro
``` -->

Not now.

## Features

1. export to django application via urls.py
2. to flask application via dependency rejection.
3. and so on...

## Minds

I have tried to solve the problem of lacking engineer.
However, `micro` is not the best solution probably.
